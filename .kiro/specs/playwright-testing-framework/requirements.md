# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a comprehensive Playwright testing framework for the existing web application. The framework will be organized as a separate project within the current workspace, featuring Page Object Model (POM) architecture, reusable fixtures, and independent test flows. The testing suite will cover full user journeys while maintaining test isolation and following best practices for end-to-end testing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want a well-structured Playwright testing project, so that I can efficiently write and maintain automated tests for the web application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the project THEN the system SHALL create a separate folder with its own package.json
2. WHEN organizing the project structure THEN the system SHALL implement Page Object Model (POM) pattern
3. WHEN configuring the project THEN the system SHALL use JavaScript as the primary language
4. WHEN setting up dependencies THEN the system SHALL include Playwright and necessary testing utilities

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a test developer, I want reusable page objects and components, so that I can write maintainable tests without code duplication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating page objects THEN the system SHALL implement base page classes with common functionality
2. WHEN designing components THEN the system SHALL create reusable component classes for UI elements
3. WHEN structuring pages THEN the system SHALL separate page logic from test logic
4. WHEN implementing selectors THEN the system SHALL use data-testid attributes where possible

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a test engineer, I want independent test flows, so that tests can run in isolation without dependencies on other tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing test flows THEN each test SHALL be completely independent
2. WHEN setting up test data THEN the system SHALL use fixtures for test data management
3. WHEN cleaning up THEN each test SHALL clean up its own data
4. WHEN running tests THEN tests SHALL not rely on execution order

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage for user flows, so that I can ensure the application works correctly from end to end.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing authentication THEN the system SHALL cover login, registration, and logout flows
2. WHEN testing core features THEN the system SHALL cover diary, foods, and reports functionality
3. WHEN testing user interactions THEN the system SHALL validate UI responses and data persistence
4. WHEN testing error scenarios THEN the system SHALL verify proper error handling

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a test maintainer, I want proper test organization and configuration, so that tests are easy to run, debug, and extend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing tests THEN the system SHALL group tests by feature/functionality
2. WHEN configuring Playwright THEN the system SHALL set up multiple browser support
3. WHEN implementing reporting THEN the system SHALL generate HTML Playwright reports
4. WHEN setting up CI/CD THEN the system SHALL be configured for CI pipeline integration
5. WHEN debugging THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and screenshots on failure

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a test developer, I want reusable fixtures and utilities, so that I can efficiently set up test scenarios and share common functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating fixtures THEN the system SHALL provide user authentication fixtures
2. WHEN setting up test data THEN the system SHALL create data generation utilities
3. WHEN implementing helpers THEN the system SHALL provide common assertion helpers
4. WHEN managing state THEN the system SHALL handle browser context and storage management

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want CI/CD integration with HTML reporting, so that I can monitor test results and integrate testing into the deployment pipeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests in CI THEN the system SHALL generate HTML Playwright reports
2. WHEN configuring CI pipeline THEN the system SHALL provide GitHub Actions workflow configuration
3. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL publish test artifacts and reports
4. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed failure information in CI logs
