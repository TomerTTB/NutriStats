# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Transform the existing food diary application from a development prototype into a production-ready system that can handle real users, scale effectively, and maintain data integrity and security. The system needs robust infrastructure, proper data management, comprehensive security measures, monitoring capabilities, and deployment automation while preserving all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to use a proper database instead of JSON files, so that data is reliable, scalable, and supports concurrent users safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL connect to a PostgreSQL database instead of reading JSON files
2. WHEN multiple users access the system simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent operations without data corruption
3. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error responses and maintain data consistency
4. WHEN the application needs to scale THEN the database SHALL support connection pooling and optimized queries

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security-conscious operator, I want all sensitive configuration and secrets to be externalized and secured, so that the application follows security best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL load all configuration from environment variables
2. WHEN session secrets are needed THEN they SHALL be loaded from secure environment variables, not hardcoded
3. WHEN database credentials are required THEN they SHALL be loaded from environment variables or secure vaults
4. WHEN the application runs in production THEN it SHALL enforce HTTPS and secure cookie settings
5. WHEN authentication occurs THEN it SHALL implement proper password policies and rate limiting

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want comprehensive logging and error handling, so that I can quickly diagnose and resolve issues in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any error occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information with appropriate log levels
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL log request/response information for monitoring
3. WHEN the application encounters unhandled errors THEN it SHALL log them and respond gracefully without crashing
4. WHEN logs are generated THEN they SHALL be structured and include correlation IDs for request tracing
5. WHEN the system is monitored THEN logs SHALL be accessible through centralized logging systems

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want automated deployment and infrastructure management, so that the application can be deployed consistently across environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the application THEN it SHALL use containerization with Docker
2. WHEN infrastructure is provisioned THEN it SHALL be defined as code using infrastructure tools
3. WHEN deployments occur THEN they SHALL be automated through CI/CD pipelines
4. WHEN different environments are needed THEN the system SHALL support development, staging, and production configurations
5. WHEN health checks are performed THEN the application SHALL provide proper health endpoints

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive testing coverage, so that the application is reliable and changes can be made safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN it SHALL have corresponding unit tests with good coverage
2. WHEN API endpoints are implemented THEN they SHALL have integration tests
3. WHEN the application is built THEN all tests SHALL pass before deployment
4. WHEN database operations are performed THEN they SHALL be tested with proper test data isolation
5. WHEN frontend functionality is implemented THEN it SHALL have end-to-end tests for critical user flows

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want monitoring and alerting capabilities, so that I can proactively manage system health and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL expose metrics for monitoring systems
2. WHEN system resources are consumed THEN metrics SHALL track CPU, memory, and database performance
3. WHEN errors occur THEN alerts SHALL be triggered for critical issues
4. WHEN users interact with the system THEN usage metrics SHALL be collected for analysis
5. WHEN performance degrades THEN the monitoring system SHALL provide actionable insights

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a data administrator, I want proper data backup and recovery procedures, so that user data is protected and can be restored if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system operates THEN it SHALL perform automated database backups
2. WHEN data corruption occurs THEN the system SHALL support point-in-time recovery
3. WHEN backups are created THEN they SHALL be stored securely in multiple locations
4. WHEN recovery is needed THEN the process SHALL be documented and tested regularly
5. WHEN user data is migrated THEN the process SHALL preserve data integrity and relationships

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an end user, I want the application to perform well under load, so that my experience remains smooth even as the user base grows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple users access the system THEN response times SHALL remain under 500ms for typical operations
2. WHEN the system experiences high load THEN it SHALL implement proper caching strategies
3. WHEN database queries are executed THEN they SHALL be optimized with appropriate indexes
4. WHEN static assets are served THEN they SHALL be optimized and cached effectively
5. WHEN the system scales THEN it SHALL support horizontal scaling through load balancing

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want proper security measures implemented, so that user data is protected and the system meets security standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users authenticate THEN the system SHALL implement secure session management
2. WHEN data is transmitted THEN it SHALL be encrypted in transit using HTTPS
3. WHEN sensitive data is stored THEN it SHALL be encrypted at rest
4. WHEN API requests are made THEN they SHALL be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks
5. WHEN security vulnerabilities are discovered THEN the system SHALL have processes for rapid patching

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want all existing functionality preserved during the production readiness transformation, so that current users experience no disruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is upgraded THEN all current food tracking features SHALL continue to work
2. WHEN users log in THEN their existing data SHALL be accessible and intact
3. WHEN the API is called THEN all existing endpoints SHALL maintain backward compatibility
4. WHEN the frontend is accessed THEN all current user interface functionality SHALL be preserved
5. WHEN data migration occurs THEN all user data SHALL be transferred accurately without loss
